# Legions of Shadows

From time to time a thought crosses my mind. Make a game. As a teenager I
learned programming through making games. The yellow on blue of the Turbo Pascal
editor became for me an haven. Do you know how it is to learn programming before
the days of internet? I went to the library, there was (miracausly) a stack of
tech magazines, with an article series regarding the pascal. Like litterally all
the code printed over few pages. No copy/paste, uif you want it copy it all
letter by letter by yourself. The problem was the library didn't have the
magazines organized and complete. It was random stack you have to scan through,
select if it has pascal code otherwise return back. And I could take only 3
issues at the time. And the sometimes the programs were over my level of
understanding. The one useful knowledge I remember I got from it was a
filesystem I/O, list of records. The magazine's version was about employess. I
have rewritten it to a manager of CDs where I tracked which of my CD (mostly
bundle of old games) I have borrowed to which classmate.

Another big deal resource of knowledge that the universe blessed me with was my
neighbour. Rudolf was his name. Rudolf was a classmate of my brother and he
introduced me to him. He was living just few houses up the street, but otherwise
because of the age distance I would never have any conversation with him. So
Rudo was already in Gymnasium (high school), they had informatics classes, and
most importantly he was an enthusiast himself. One Sunday afternoon I got
arranged a visit at his house. I was watching the clock not to be late. Five
minutes before I grabbed my programming notebook (meaning pen and paper), and
slightly nervous stepped out.

He was not polite, but not rude as well. It felt a bit as I am annoyance to him,
wasting time with me. But there I was, so the tour can start. He didn't proram
in Turbo Pascal. Currently he was doing something in C or whatevery it was.\
But because I didn't know anything else he showed me his older school project written
in Pascal. It was a manager of cards. Just shortly, thes cards were like an Anki
cards, but mainly focused on Slovak literature. You create them with specific fields
like author, book, year, main idea, etc. Anyway, it sounded pretty cool, the code
was just a scroll in front my face, not able to read and underdstand anything. But
I had a question prepared. I don't remember what exactly it was about, but I remember
that I was in stage of dealing with graphics and mouse support. And I remember that
Rudo was able to help me.

I entered my last era of turbo pascal. Games with simple graphics. And with
Rudo's help I was able to create an essential tool - a sprite editor. With mouse
I could draw simple geometry, select colors, basically much much simpler MS
Paint. And the created sprites I could use in the games. I have programmed,
Kezmarok's Witch - simple Tyrian like game where a witch flying on a broom was
avoiding bats casted by enemy witch; and a Legions of Shadow - simple managment
games where you gathered build an fortress with wood worker shack and metal mine
to gather resources, and then used it to hire an army to fight of army of snake
people. It was turn-based with random events mechanics which were either good or
bad. It was inspired by a
[book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42388646-the-shadow-kingdom) I have
before borrowed from the town's library.

TODO: recover and upload old sources to the cloud

During the years of university and professional life after I forgot about
gamecraft with an exception of once playing with early version of Godot with an
idea of creating some simple factorio-like game. It was left unfinished in early
stages. And the urge from childhood appeared again now. When I have discovered
the AI generated images I was thinking what could I do. And the first naive was
idea was to do a remake of Legions of Shadow.

# Planning phase

# Mechanism

Card collection / managerial game. Harvesting resources which would allow
purchases of cards. Global good and bad events. Combat turn based.

# Backstory

Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom ruled by a cruel and dread king, a great
fortress stood tall and proud. The fortress was the kingdom's first line of
defense against any enemy who dared to attack, and it had never been preserved.

But one dark and stormy night, an army of snake people emerged from the shadows,
their hissing and slithering filling the air. The guards on duty at the fortress
were caught off guard and quickly overwhelmed by the swift and deadly creatures.

The king and his bravest warriors rushed to defend their home, armed with their
trusty swords and bows. But they were no match for the army of snake people. The
snakes swarmed the fortress, their venomous fangs sinking into flesh and their
powerful coils crushing anything in their path.

The king, seeing that his warriors were struggling, ordered his sorcerers to
unleash their most powerful spells on the snake people. The sorcerers obeyed,
unleashing a barrage of magical attacks that decimated the ranks of the snake
people.

But even the sorcerers' magic was not enough to defeat the army of snake people.
The battle raged on, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.

Just when all hope seemed lost, a lone figure emerged from the wilderness. He
was a fierce and barbaric warrior, known throughout the land as Conan the
Conqueror. Conan had been wandering the wilderness for many years, honing his
combat skills and gaining great strength and power.

Conan charged into battle, his mighty sword flashing in the light. He fought
with a ferocity and skill that no one had ever seen before, cutting down snake
people left and right. The snake people recoiled in fear before this new threat,
unsure of how to deal with this barbarian warrior.

Conan fought his way to the king, who was cowering in fear at the back of the
fortress. The king begged for mercy, but Conan was having none of it. With a
mighty swing of his sword, he beheaded the king and ended his reign of terror.

The snake people, seeing their leader slain, turned and fled back into the
shadows from which they had come. The kingdom was saved, thanks to the bravery
and strength of Conan the Conqueror.

The people cheered and hailed Conan as their hero, thanking him for his bravery
and strength. Conan, however, was not interested in their praise. He simply
disappeared back into the wilderness, leaving the kingdom to rebuild and thrive
once more.
