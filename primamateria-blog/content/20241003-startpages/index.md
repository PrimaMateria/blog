Have you ever wished for a more personalized and efficient way to start your
browsing sessions? Enter Startpages â€“ customizable web pages designed to replace
your browser's new tab page and provide quick access to your curated list of
links. Today, I'm excited to share a personal project I've been relying on for
some time.

## What are Startpages and Why Should You Care?

Startpages are more than just pretty interfaces; they're productivity boosters.
While many browser extensions offer visually appealing new tab pages, I wanted
something different â€“ a simple, practical solution with a dense list of links
organized into categories that matter to me.

ðŸš€ [**Demo**](https://primamateria.github.io/startpages-template/home.html) -
See an example setup with Home and Development start pages.

## Project Goals

1. **Simplicity**: A clean, no-frills interface
2. **Practicality**: Quick access to frequently used links
3. **Customization**: Easy to tailor to individual needs
4. **Organization**: Ability to categorize links efficiently

## Color Schemes

fingertips!

Dark color schemes

</div>

More dark color schemes

<div style="margin-top: 9px">
{{ resize_image_w(path="20241003-startpages/montage-dark-b.png", width=748) }}
</div>

And some light color schemes

<div style="margin-top: 9px">
{{ resize_image_w(path="20241003-startpages/montage-light.png", width=748) }}
</div>


## Content Structure

Essentially, it is a single YAML file that you can edit directly using the
GitHub web editor.

<div style="margin-top: 9px">
{{ resize_image_w(path="20241003-startpages/startpages-content-edit.png", width=748) }}
</div>

The structure goes like this

<div style="margin-top: 24px">
{{ resize_image_w(path="20241003-startpages/content-schema.png", width=748) }}
</div>

- **Multiple Start Pages**: Switch between different contexts (e.g., Home,
  Development)
- **Columns & Categories**: Group related links for easy access
- **Custom Icons**: Use Font Awesome icons or any HTML content for link
  representation

## Getting Started

## Browser Integration

Make your Startpage the default new tab with these extensions:

- [Firefox New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
- [Chrome New Tab Override](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/new-tab-override/fjcmlondipcnnpmbcollgifldmajfonf)

**Pro Tip**: Vimium users can enable page focus in Firefox's New Tab Override
settings for keyboard navigation with the 'f' key.

## Under the Hood

This project is powered by:

- **Zola**: A fast, flexible static site generator written in Rust
- **Tera**: A powerful templating engine
- **YAML**: For easy content management

## Conclusion

Startpages offer a unique way to tailor your browsing experience to your needs.
Whether you're a productivity enthusiast or just someone who likes things
organized, this project might be just what you're looking for.
